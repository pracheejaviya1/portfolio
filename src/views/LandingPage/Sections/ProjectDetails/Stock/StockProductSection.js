            This project studied and tested fundamental and technical features
            to create a model that can classify/- cluster stock tickers as BUY
            SELL or HOLD signals. Using algorithms such as Logistic Regression,
            Linear Regression, Knearest Neighbor, Decision Trees to create an
            accurate classifier/clustering model and use Bagging and Boosting
            techniques to achieve better performance. After the project I
            realised there are better methods (neural networks, deep learning)
            to achieve higher accuracy. However, the end goal of this project
            was getting a "hands-on" on the subject machine learning .

                            works successfully 50% of the time. But for the purposes of
                            learning machine learning classification, it was enough. We
                            could potentially add more features to improve the model or
                            alter the features we have based on new strategies. Ripping
                            the decision trees and building algorithms from scratch
                            increased the accuracy. Killing nodes that lead to overfitting
                            also increased the accuracy by 0.2. We saw that out of all
                            the algorithms, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoosting
                            worked the best, giving 50% accuracy."
